# IneuronTasks
This is a task where I am extracting some data from a csv file which is present in my local system and storing those data in a structured way in side Mongo DB ATLAS.
I've tried to make this code modular but it seems not to be, sorry!
I've performed many functions like insert_many,delete_many,filter
